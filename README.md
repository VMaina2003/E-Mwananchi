# E-Mwananchi
In many parts of Kenya, citizens see problems every day — a broken road, a dark street, a school without teachers, a clinic without medicine — yet their voices rarely reach those who can act. On the other hand, county governments work on projects and improvements, but few people ever see the progress made. This gap in communication creates frustration, mistrust, and slow development.

E-Mwananchi bridges this gap — giving citizens a simple way to report issues that matter, and enabling governments to respond, update, and showcase real progress transparently.
